# Metroid Prime port — working notes

Goal: turn the Metroid Prime recompilation experiment into an actual, maintainable
PC port by building the PrimeDecomp matching decompilation against the Aurora
compatibility layer (MIT), instead of a static-recomp module on a Dolphin-derived
runtime.

## Architecture

- Game + engine: PrimeDecomp/prime `src/` + `include/` (real C++, targets
  `GM8E01_00`, the same disc we own).
- Platform/GPU/input/disc/saves/UI: `extern/aurora` (MIT). Aurora provides a
  drop-in `dolphin/*` SDK API plus an SDL3 + WebGPU(Dawn) app layer and a
  performant GX implementation.
- Assets: read from the user's own disc (`orig/GM8E01_00/`); nothing is
  distributed.
- Integration reference: Dusklight (Twilight Princess port) — same CMake shape
  (`extern/aurora`, decomp sources listed in a `files.cmake`, `aurora::*` libs).

## Status (2026-09-18)

- Repo cloned, branch `port`; `extern/musyx` and `extern/aurora` submodules present.
- Matching decomp builds and reproduces the retail DOL byte-for-byte:
  `build/GM8E01_00/main.dol` sha1 `949c5ed7368aef547e0b0db1c3678f466e2afbff`.
  Report: SDK 100%, Core Engine (Kyoto) 90.99%, Game 87.50% matched.
  `objdiff.json` is available for reference diffing.
- Aurora `examples/simple` builds on this machine (prebuilt Dawn for
  linux-x86_64 is fetched automatically by CMake).

### Port scaffold build status (2026-09-18)

`CMakeLists.txt` + `files.cmake` (632 sources) + `platform/{compat.h,main.cpp}` build
`mp_game` against Aurora. First full compile went 1269 -> 138 errors after:
- `platform/compat.h` (force-included) restoring the SDK `AUTO`/`AUTO_REF`/
  `AUTO_CONST_REF` macros Aurora omits;
- excluding `src/NESemu/modwrapper.cpp` (raw PowerPC asm) and
  `src/MetroidPrime/TypesMatch.cpp` (decomp-only type scaffolding);
- `-Wno-narrowing`.

Remaining 138 errors are a bounded compatibility-shim queue:
- GX declarations Aurora implements but does not declare in headers:
  `GXSetTexCopyDst/Src`, `GXPixModeSync`, `GXCopyTex`, `GXSetTevColor`,
  `GXInitLightPos/Attn`, `GXSetCullMode`; plus a `GXSetArray` signature
  difference (Aurora adds a 5th arg).
- Missing SDK headers: `dolphin/arq.h`, `dolphin/thp/THPInfo.h`.
- `OSContext` member mismatches (`gpr`, `srr0`) in the game's own view.
- `COBBTree::CNode::operator new` placement-new mismatch.

### Build clears (2026-09-18)

`metroid_prime_port` now **compiles and links**: all 632 decomp sources build
against Aurora with zero errors and produce a 64.5 MB executable that
initializes Aurora and a Vulkan device.

What clearing the remaining errors required:
- `platform/compat.h` (force-included): libc, the GX/SI/PAD/OS/CARD umbrellas,
  `AUTO*`, `nofralloc`, `__abs`, and the `triggerL/R` -> `triggerLeft/Right`
  mapping for Aurora's `TARGET_PC` `PADStatus`.
- `platform/include/dolphin/{arq,gba,PPCArch,thp/*}.h`: SDK headers Aurora omits
  (arq.h re-exports Aurora's `ar.h`; the rest are the original SDK declarations).
- `platform/include/dolphin/gx/GXShims.h` + `platform/shims.cpp`: GX token,
  breakpoint, and write-gather-pipe entry points Aurora lacks, plus GBA/PPC
  shims.
- Decomp source fixes (port-only, documented in code comments): `RAssertDolphin`
  OSContext dump guarded for opaque PC `OSContext`; `rstl/string.hpp` declares
  the member specializations `rstl_strings.cpp` defines (clang requires
  declaration before instantiation); `GXSetArray` call updated to Aurora's
  5-arg form; small conversion casts; `CARDFormatAsync` declaration only (Aurora
  defines it); case-corrected `Kyoto/CCrc32.hpp` include.
- CMake: `LINK_GROUP:RESCAN` around `aurora::core`/`aurora::gx` to break their
  static-library cycle; excluded `src/NESemu` (raw PowerPC asm).

### Boot progress (2026-09-18)

`metroid_prime_port` now boots well into initialization under Aurora:
1. Aurora initializes (Vulkan device, 2240x1680 framebuffer, CARD, ARAM `0x1000000`).
2. Disc mounts via `aurora_dvd_open` (user's ISO).
3. Game entry runs: `CMain` ctor, `RsMain`, `CGameGlobalObjects` ctor, default font
   (zlib) load, `InitializeSubsystems` (AR/ARQ), `PostInitialize`.
4. GX commands reach Aurora's FIFO worker and a frame is presented.

Issues fixed along the way:
- zlib ABI: the bundled zlib 1.1.3 declares a non-standard 3-arg `inflateInit2_`;
  retargeted to the standard 4-arg form so it matches the linked zlib-ng.
- `TOneStatic<T>` 1-arg `operator new` had no definition.
- The guest stack "paint" in `InitializeSubsystems` wrote to address 0 (no emulated
  guest stack); skipped it on PC and gave the dummy `OSThread` a MEM1 stack range.
- Aurora aborted when the game's error handler called `PADRead` before `PADInit`.

Current blocker: the game's custom `CGameAllocator` (main heap) returns null for a
64 KB allocation in `CDvdFile::StartARAMFileLoad` (loading `aram:Tweaks.pak`),
which triggers the error handler (and then Aurora's `PADRead before PADInit`
fatal). Two separate issues:

1. **Heap sizing (fixed).** Aurora's internal framebuffer defaulted to the
   window-scaled 2240x1680, so the game's two `x2c_frameBufferSize` allocations
   took ~15 MB of the 24 MB MEM1, leaving only a ~10 MB game heap. Pinning
   `windowWidth/Height` to 640x480 raised the heap to ~20 MB. (Aurora still
   scales the internal fb to 1120x840 @1.75; a true 640x480 fb needs the DPI
   scale forced to 1.)
2. **Allocator free-list (open).** With ~20 MB free the 64 KB allocation still
   fails, so `CGameAllocator`'s free-block/split bookkeeping is not surviving on
   the 64-bit host (`SGameMemInfo` packs flags in low pointer bits and uses
   `sizeof(SGameMemInfo)`, which is ~4x larger than on GameCube). Needs a focused
   pass over `FindFreeBlock`/`FixupAllocPtrs`/`AddFreeEntryToFreeList`.

Temporary memory diagnostics are in `CGameAllocator::Initialize` and
`COsContext::OpenWindow` (stderr prints of heap/arena/framebuffer sizes).

### Bring-up fixes after the allocator (2026-09-18)

The game now runs through `PostInitialize`/`AddPaksAndFactories` pak loading with
no crashes. Fixes landed:
- **`CGameAllocator` overflow** (root cause of the OOM): `Alloc(0x20)`/`Alloc(0x1c)`
  for `CSmallAllocPool`/`CMediumAllocPool` were 32-bit object sizes; on x86-64 the
  objects are larger and overflowed the next free block's header. Now use
  `sizeof(...)`. Free list stays healthy.
- **ARQ recursion**: Aurora's `ARQPostRequest` invoked the ARAM completion callback
  synchronously, so `CDvdFile::PingARAMTransfer <-> HandleARAMInterrupt` recursed to
  stack overflow. Callbacks are now queued and drained by an iterative `ARQPoll()`
  at explicit pump/wait points. Running the poll inside `ARQPostRequest` was still
  too early: multi-chunk transfers observed stale length/interrupt state and left
  `aram:MiscData.pak` permanently loading.
- **GX breakpoint / VI retrace**: `CGraphics::EndScene` spins on
  `mNumBreakpointsWaiting`, which only a VI retrace decrements. `GXEnableBreakPt`
  now pulses the registered breakpoint + pre/post retrace callbacks (stored by the
  VI shims) so frames complete.
- **`delete` on CMemory memory**: `rstl::aligned_allocator::deallocate` used
  `delete[]` while `allocate` used `CMemory::Alloc`; on clang the game's
  `operator delete`->`CMemory::Free` is MWCC-only, so glibc freed a game pointer.
  Routed the free to `CMemory::Free`; `CDvdFileARAM` buffers now use `rs_new`.

The apparent frame-slot deadlock was normal frame pacing. The repeated
`CGraphics::EndScene` caller was the initial pak-loading loop; after fixing ARQ
completion ordering and synchronous ARAM waits, startup reaches the main loop
(`MP frame` verified through frame 361). Resource buffers passed to `delete`-based
owners now use matching host allocations, and palette frame state is initialized
so ARAM palette storage follows delayed `CMemory::Free` cleanup.

Further host bring-up fixes now sustain the main loop through at least frame 48,601:
- GameCube AGSC payloads are big-endian 32-bit MusyX structures, while the vendored
  host runtime expects native-endian structures (including 64-bit sample directory
  pointers). `CAudioGrpSetLoc` now converts the pool, project, and sample directory
  into host-native layout on little-endian hosts: big-endian `GROUP_DATA`,
  `POOL_DATA`, `MEM_DATA`/`FX_TAB`, ID lists, and `SDIR_DATA_INTER` are byte-swapped
  and expanded to native `SDIR_DATA`; raw curve bodies and PCM samples are left
  untouched. MusyX group push/pop is enabled again and `sndPushGroup` succeeds for
  the boot groups. A `s32`->`size_t` cast in `dataAddSampleReference` fixes truncation
  of 64-bit sample bases.
- CMDL header fields, section sizes, bounds, and per-surface metadata are byte-swapped
  before model setup. Surface parent/next links are expanded in place for 64-bit hosts
  while raw GX display lists remain untouched.
- Movie buffers owned by `single_ptr`/`auto_ptr` use matching host allocations and
  rounded DVD request sizes instead of placing `CMemory::Alloc` pointers behind
  host `delete` owners.
- Aurora keyboard input has initial GameCube mappings when no saved mapping exists:
  WASD and IJKL drive the sticks, X/Z/C/V map A/B/X/Y, Return maps Start, and the
  arrow keys map the D-pad. Existing user mappings and physical controllers win.
- PATH version-4 resources are read field-by-field into native vectors. Packed
  big-endian node, link, region, connectivity, and octree fields are converted and
  their 32-bit indices are rebased only after vector storage is stable.
- CMDL and MREA geometry now share native surface-header conversion, including
  material indices, display-list lengths, pointer-sized renderer links, normals,
  and optional bounds.
- MusyX now uses the upstream `origin/sdl3` PC backend (merged into the vendored
  submodule, with conflicts resolved in favor of the host `s64` typedef and the SDL
  mutex IRQ). It provides a software voice mixer covering ADPCM/PCM decode, pitch
  resampling, ADSR envelopes, and studio/AUX mixing, and feeds interleaved `s16`
  stereo to an SDL3 audio stream. PC sequence playback is enabled again and the
  audio thread drives `snd_handle_irq`.
- Big-endian `ARR` song payloads from `CSNG` resources are converted in place for
  little-endian hosts before sequencing: header offsets, the 64-entry track table,
  per-track `TENTRY` arrays, the `MTRACK` tempo list, the pattern table, pattern
  headers, and `NOTE_DATA` note streams are byte-swapped. Byte-oriented pitch-bend
  and modulation streams need no conversion.
- Native text rendering checks explicit string lengths before dereferencing the
  next character. Palette entries, MREA section buffers, and map buffers now return
  to the allocator that created them during runtime and delayed shutdown cleanup.
- AGSC group buffers are retained for the session on PC. `hwSaveSample` never copies
  samples into ARAM here, and the MusyX 2.0.0 `sndPopGroup` path can leave voices
  referencing sample data after a group is popped, so freeing the buffer left the
  audio thread reading unmapped memory (confirmed with AddressSanitizer).
- `CCameraFilterPass::DrawRandomStatic` previously faked a random main-memory
  address as its texture source (the GameCube renderer ignored the pointer, the PC
  renderer hashes it). It now samples a real scratch buffer of noise, sized for the
  tiled IA4 extent.
- DVD ARAM streaming state is serialized with a recursive mutex: `OSDisableInterrupts`
  is a no-op on PC, and the DVD worker and main threads raced on the transfer
  counters until `mBufferLen` went negative and `ARQPostRequest` memcpy'd a huge
  length. Non-positive transfer lengths are also treated as complete.
- Vertex array byte sizes are threaded through to `GXSetArray`. Aurora uploads
  `size` bytes of each attribute array, and the port was passing 0, so every
  array-based draw (MREA world geometry, CMDL models, skinned models) uploaded
  zero bytes and rendered nothing while immediate-mode effects and the HUD still
  drew. Positions, normals, colors, and UVs now carry the section sizes from the
  MREA/CMDL loaders.
- The PC MusyX mixer render thread is paced to real time. It previously free-ran
  (measured ~29x real time) because it only throttled on the SDL queue depth,
  overrunning the stream and producing dropouts; it now sleeps until the next
  160-sample frame is due, which removed the buffer-boundary discontinuities.
- Streamed audio (front-end music) now decodes correctly: `DecodeMonoAndMix` wrote
  the decoded samples *on top of* the buffer still being played, feeding the
  output back into itself until it saturated into full-scale noise. It writes the
  decoded samples now, `IsReady` waits for every chunk rather than only the last,
  and the non-ARAM `CDvdFile` read is blocking (`DVDReadPrio`) so playback cannot
  start on unfilled buffers.
- The GameCube audio-interface DMA path is implemented in `platform/ai_dma.cpp`:
  the registered DMA callback is driven from the main loop (`AIPortPoll`) at the
  buffer rate and the submitted buffer is fed to its own SDL stream. Streamed
  audio (front-end/in-game music via `CStaticAudioPlayer`, movie audio)
  previously had no output at all because the AI functions were no-ops. It runs on
  the main thread because the guest mixer is not thread-safe, and the port keeps
  the full 64-bit DMA pointer that the SDK's 32-bit `AIGetDMAStartAddr` truncates.
  `MP_DISABLE_AI_AUDIO=1` isolates this path.
- Skinned vertex generation advances its output cursor explicitly. On the console
  the write-gather pipe advances itself as data is written, so `BuildPoints`,
  `BuildNormals`, and `Calculate`'s padding pass all reused one `pipe` value; on PC
  that made every bone overwrite the same offset and left the rest of the
  workspace uninitialised (vertex explosions). The vertex/normal workspaces are
  also one contiguous allocation, matching the points-then-normals write order.
- Runtime-generated vertex arrays are marked host-native (`le=true`) instead of
  big-endian, matching the port's native skinning/workspace writes. `ClearArray`
  forces the backend to drop its cached copy, which the skinned path needs because
  the workspace pointer is reused every frame. The map-screen mappable-object and
  area surfaces still pass no vertex size and remain to be converted.

Host shutdown now completes cleanly. Game-heap buffers owned by `CGBASupport`,
`CStaticAudioPlayer`, and `SMediumAllocPuddle` are released through `CMemory` instead
of host `delete`, and the PC build skips the guest-stack usage scan that it does not
initialize.

## Next steps

Automated PAD input now advances through the front end, initializes the first room,
constructs `CInGameGuiManager` and `CMFGame`, and runs beyond frame 58,000 with an
AddressSanitizer-clean run past frame 21,000 and a normal exit on forced SIGTERM.

Verified with injected input and state probes:
- Left-stick input moves the player; the walk stays grounded (height ~0.8) and is
  constrained by room collision, so input, physics, and collision are all live.
- The player stays alive (`CPlayer::x9f4_deathTime` remains 0). The earlier death at
  ~frame 11,400 was a symptom of the DVD ARAM race rather than game logic.
- The MusyX mixer outputs non-zero interleaved PCM during gameplay (left/right
  samples in the thousands).

1. Restore a screenshot path. `xwd` now fails for both the game window and the root
   (`unable to get image at 0x0+0+0`) even though the window reports `IsViewable`
   640x480, so whether the dark first-room framebuffer is correct is unverified.
2. Confirm MusyX music and effects are audible end to end, and validate the mixer
   against a variety of songs, samples, and streaming audio.
3. Replace the session-long AGSC buffer retention with a proper lifetime once MusyX
   voice lifetimes are understood.
4. Exercise room transitions and CARD saves with richer automated input.
