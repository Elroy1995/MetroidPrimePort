# Metroid Prime port — working notes

Goal: turn the Metroid Prime recompilation experiment into an actual, maintainable
PC port by building the PrimeDecomp matching decompilation against the Aurora
compatibility layer (MIT), instead of a static-recomp module on a Dolphin-derived
runtime.

## Architecture

- Game + engine: PrimeDecomp/prime `src/` + `include/` (real C++, targets
  `GM8E01_00`, the same disc we own).
- Platform/GPU/input/disc/saves/UI: `extern/aurora` (MIT). Aurora provides a
  drop-in `dolphin/*` SDK API plus an SDL3 + WebGPU(Dawn) app layer and a
  performant GX implementation.
- Assets: read from the user's own disc (`orig/GM8E01_00/`); nothing is
  distributed.
- Integration reference: Dusklight (Twilight Princess port) — same CMake shape
  (`extern/aurora`, decomp sources listed in a `files.cmake`, `aurora::*` libs).

## Status (2026-09-18)

- Repo cloned, branch `port`; `extern/musyx` and `extern/aurora` submodules present.
- Matching decomp builds and reproduces the retail DOL byte-for-byte:
  `build/GM8E01_00/main.dol` sha1 `949c5ed7368aef547e0b0db1c3678f466e2afbff`.
  Report: SDK 100%, Core Engine (Kyoto) 90.99%, Game 87.50% matched.
  `objdiff.json` is available for reference diffing.
- Aurora `examples/simple` builds on this machine (prebuilt Dawn for
  linux-x86_64 is fetched automatically by CMake).

## Next steps

1. Add a port CMake target mirroring Dusklight: list the decomp sources, link
   `aurora::core gx gd si vi pad mtx os dvd thp card`, add an application entry
   point.
2. Compile the decomp `src/` with clang against Aurora's `include/dolphin/*`
   (not `extern/sdk`); fix per-file issues iteratively.
3. Platform glue: `aurora::main` entry, PAD input, DVD via nod (ISO), CARD
   saves (`.gci`/`.raw`). VI/GX already provided.
4. Fill decomp gaps that block the modern-compiler build (functions not yet
   decompiled cannot come from the original MIPS asm in a port).

## Licensing

- Aurora: MIT. Port-specific code: ours.
- The decompiled game/engine source and the game assets remain Nintendo's; this
  is the usual decomp-port situation. Ship no assets; require the user's disc.
- The earlier recomp path (GPL: DolRecomp / ModernGekko) is preserved separately
  and is not linked into the port.

## Preserved recomp baseline

- git tag `recomp-baseline-2026-09-18` in the MetroidPrimeRecomp repo.
- Backup bundle and build artifacts under `/home/odran/backups/` (`mpr-*`).
