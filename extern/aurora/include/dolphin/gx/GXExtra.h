// surface's own colour with no lighting, 2 has the base map's alpha mask the glow instead
// of being the opacity, 4 has the vertex colour tint the surface; the sum of those. `layer` is the blend of a second layer (texture maps 4-6:
// base, MR, normal) over the first by the vertex alpha and the two base maps' alphas: the
// width of its edge, then the scale and offset of the first layer's height and of the

// multiplied into the base, 3 scales the glow by the vertex alpha (lava), 4 is ice: map 4
// is seen inside the surface, at a depth of the base map's alpha times the fourth
// parameter, through a fresnel of power and weight the first two; the third scales the
// normal map and the strength is the inside's glow. Kinds 5-8 are liquids, falling water
// and glass (see shader.cpp). 9 is a beam's glow: map 4's channels are noise scrolling at
// the layer's four scale/offset values (red, green) and the second and third parameters
