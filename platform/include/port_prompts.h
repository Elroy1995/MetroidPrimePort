// Binding-aware button prompt icons.
//
// The game draws each prompt from a fixed texture, so a shipped replacement can
// only ever show one device's icon. This module instead registers, at runtime,
// the icon for the input actually bound to each prompt's action, so rebinding a
// key or mouse button is reflected in game. The icons are pre-rendered per
// input by tools/make_prompt_glyphs.py into <textures>/bindings/.
//
// A keyboard follows the key bindings and a pad follows its button mapping. The
// icons are registered above the static per-device set, which stays in place
// for any prompt the module has no icon for.
namespace PortPrompts {
// The device the player last used: "keyboard", the connected pad's type (see
// PortTextures::PadDeviceName), or the touch overlay's layout ("xbox" or
// "gamecube"). MP_TEXTURE_DEVICE overrides it. Both the prompts and the static
// texture set follow this.

// Call once after Aurora is up, with the same texture root the replacements
// came from (null or empty disables the module).
void Initialize(const char* textureRoot);

// Re-registers an action's icon when its binding changed. Call once per frame.
void Poll();

// Tells the prompts that the touch overlay was just used, and in which layout
// (true for the twin-stick Xbox arrangement, false for the GameCube one), so the
// in-game prompts follow the input the player actually reached for.
